  <h1>Dataset Analysis for Classification</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the dataset analysis for classification task! 📊🔍 This repository contains a dataset with features and a target class label. We've applied various classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree to find the best output for predicting the target class.</p>

  <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains the following features:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>feature1</li>
    <li>feature2</li>
    <li>feature3</li>
    <li>feature4</li>
    <li>feature5</li>
    <li>feature6</li>
    <li>feature7</li>
    <li>feature8</li>
    <li>feature9</li>
  </ol>
  <p>And one target class:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>class (binary: 0 or 1)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here's a brief overview of the dataset:</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>feature1</th>
        <th>feature2</th>
        <th>feature3</th>
        <th>feature4</th>
        <th>feature5</th>
        <th>feature6</th>
        <th>feature7</th>
        <th>feature8</th>
        <th>feature9</th>
        <th>class</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows for your dataset -->
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p>I've employed several classification algorithms to predict the target class based on the provided features. The algorithms used are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</li>
    <li>Random Forest</li>
    <li>Decision Tree</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These algorithms have been trained and evaluated on the dataset to determine their performance in predicting the target class accurately.</p>
