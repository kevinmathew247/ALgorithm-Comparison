Dataset Analysis for Classification

Welcome to the dataset analysis for classification task! 📊🔍 This repository contains a dataset with features and a target class label. We've applied various classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree to find the best output for predicting the target class.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

feature1
feature2
feature3
feature4
feature5
feature6
feature7
feature8
feature9
And one target class:

class (binary: 0 or 1)

Analysis

I've employed several classification algorithms to predict the target class based on the provided features. The algorithms used are:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Decision Tree
These algorithms have been trained and evaluated on the dataset to determine their performance in predicting the target class accurately.
